I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer working in multiple applications and getting the best insights out of data, the 21st Century gold. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, practical, innovative, and impactful solutions. My job is to create end-to-end Machine Learning products alongside performing hands-on data analyses over enormous datasets toward detecting patterns and inducing better data-driven decision making.

With over 5 years of industry experience, I have applied quantitative analysis, experiment design, and develop machine learning models for diverse business solutions. Throughout this experience, I have had the opportunity to design and create models that are helping organizations manage risk behavior profiles, reduce tax gaps, and build advanced analytical engines for forecasting and detecting deviations from unstructured information.

Lately, my focus has been on research in Artificial Intelligence, especially in making deep learning models more reliable, robust, and easier to understand, particularly in computer vision and large language models. Moreover, my work has been focused on hybrid intelligence and its application at the intersection of AI with multiple scientific areas, helping us uncover new insights and solve problems more creatively. Ultimately, I believe AI is not only about pushing the boundaries of technology; it's about ensuring these tools are used in ways that are meaningful, responsible, and truly beneficial to society.

Motor vehicle collisions are not an exception, even in cities with an outstanding public
transportation system like New York City. By analyzing crash events through 2016-2021, we see
that even though the number of collisions has presented a reduction, their dangerousness has
dramatically increased, showing a higher number of events where persons were either injured or
killed. We detected a slightly positive trend in the number of killed people in motor vehicle
crashes; meanwhile, the number of injuries reduces vaguely. Most NYC crash events happen on
Fridays, predominately around 5:00 PM. However, the most lethal time (highest number of killed
people) is during the weekends' late-night hours.

Among NYCâ€™s boroughs, Brooklyn is constantly the borough with the largest number of tragic
accidents (at least one person injured or killed), where the most predominant contributing factors
of these events are: Driver was distracted, the driver was following too closely, failure to yield
right-of-way, unsafe speed, and traffic control disregarded.
